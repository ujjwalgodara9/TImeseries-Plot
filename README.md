# Orientation Data Prediction

## Overview
This project extends the Real-Time Orientation App by exporting the historical orientation data as a text file and using it to predict the next 10 seconds of values. The predictions are then plotted against the actual values for comparison. Additionally, the sensing intervals are changed to three different values, and the process is repeated to analyze the impact on prediction accuracy.

## Developer
Ujjwal Godara, IIIT Delhi Student, Mobile Computing Course 2024

## Features
- **Data Export:** Exports the historical orientation data from the smartphone to a text file on the computer.
- **Time Series Prediction:** Uses the exported data to predict the next 10 seconds of orientation values.
- **Prediction Plotting:** Plots the predicted values against the actual values for comparison.
- **Interval Variation:** Changes the sensing intervals and repeats the prediction and plotting process.
